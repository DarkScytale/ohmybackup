## Welcome to the OhMyBackup project

Backup is so important that all companies, all personal users use a backup system ...
Well, unfortunately there is quite a lot of problems: The price of backup softwares, their complexity, their requirements, the size of the data and so much technical problems.

Finally, a such project sounds a very cool and exciting project to run and maintain !

That is why OhMyBackup was born.

Because I firstly designed for Linux OS, OhMyBackup was written on Perl. It is fully compatible with Cygwin in order to be used on MS Windows OS. At the moment it has not been
tested on Mac OS.
