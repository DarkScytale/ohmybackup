## Welcome to the OhMyBackup project

Backup is so important that all companies, all personal users use a backup system ...
Well, unfortunately there is quite a lot of problems: The price of backup softwares, their complexity, their
requirements, the size of the data and so much technical problems.

Finally, a such project sounds a very cool and exciting project to run and maintain !

That is why the project OhMyBackup was born.

Because I firstly designed it for Linux OS, OhMyBackup was written on Perl. It is fully compatible with Cygwin in
order to be used on MS Windows OS. At the moment it has not been tested on Mac OS.

## Installation

### Linux 

You need to have the Perl interpreter. On Debian / Ubuntu it is included. If it is not, please consult the package
installer of your OS to install the latest stable version.

### Microsoft Windows

You first need to install [CygWin](https://www.cygwin.com/) (version used 2.8.0). During the install phase, you need
to install the perl package.

### Mac OS X

Mac OS X has not been tested. But as far as I know, the Linux installation should be enouth for this OS.

### Others ?

For the moment, no other OS will be supported. Please contact me if you need a specific OS support.

## Commands

OMB can be run as a command line. The functions are the next ones:

### Test the JSON file.

### Convert the current JSON file.

This fonction is not actually implemented.

## Configuration

OMB uses a single JSON file which will contain the full configuration. Then it will be simple to save.
